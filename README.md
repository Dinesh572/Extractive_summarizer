Text summarization is a subdomain of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that deals with extracting summaries from huge chunks of texts. There are two main types of techniques used for text summarization: NLP-based techniques and deep learning-based techniques. In this article, we will see a simple NLP-based technique for text summarization. We will not use any machine learning library in this article. Rather we will simply use Python's NLTK library for summarizing.

There are two types of summarizier :
1. Extractive Summarizier    2. Abstractive Summarizier

# Extractive_summarizer
The summariser uses the extractive measures to generate the summary for given text which mainly based on the frequency. 

We assign scores to each sentences based on the frequency of it's words in it.

Implemented using nltk(Natural Language ToolKit) So make sure nltk library is installed
